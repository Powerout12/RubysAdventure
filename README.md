This assignment, while difficult, was very interesting. I had a couple of bugs here and there, mostly due to me forgetting to put the script into the objects and wondering why I couldn’t assign a variable. My partner and I barely talked during these two weeks, mostly because we didn’t really need to. I have confidence that he knows what he is doing with the coding for the modding assignment.
